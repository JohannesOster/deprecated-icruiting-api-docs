  summary: Upload theme
  description: '
  <p>Uplod a new .css theme for the tenants application-forms.</p>
  <p>This will update the tenants theme column to the newly created download link</p>
  <p>
    <i>Note:</i>In order to return a url to the uploaded theme-file a presigned URL would have to be created, which would take additional time.
    Since there is no user case for direct access nothing is returned.

  <i>Note:</i>Theme is not a independently resource.
  Therefore it is not referenced by an id but indirectly with the tenantId provided by the JWT-payload.
